# Blakeslist

It's not Craig's, it's mine.

This is a list of things that I'm looking to sell, if you're interested
please reach out! Prices are all negotiable, I'm more interested in clearing
space rather than making money.

Things here may get listed on eBay sooner or later, so if you want me to hold
onto something for you or anything, it's best to reach out and let me know, I
am happy to discuss!

## Warhammer Age of Sigmar

Price: £20. Very cheap because I can't be bothered looking too deeply into what
it all is, but this is probably at least 10% of the GW price.

A variety box of early Stormcast Eternals - retributors, paladins, etc. - most
of it is built and base coated, but some isn't painted. I have some stuff that
isn't assembled too.

## Books

### Warhammer 40k books (including Horus Heresy)

Price for the lot: **£50!**

I have a lot of Horus Heresy books, though I haven't worked out exactly which
ones I have. They're all paperbacks, in good condition or better, I'd say. A mix
of 1st, 2nd and 3rd editions, but mostly 1st editions I think. There are approx.
30-40 books I reckon.

I'm pretty sure it's a complete collection from the 1st book to around 2016.

There's also a few other 40k books I'll throw in with the collection!

### Star Wars Books

#### Canon Books

Price for the lot: ~~£300~~ **£200!**

Can be bought either as sets (trilogies/other books) or as a whole.

Prices are taken from the cheapest copy for sale on eBay, so if you want, you
could buy the whole lot and resell them to make a good profit! I haven't done
that just because I'm lazy :D

They're all in very good condition or better, with the sad exception of Thrawn
(2007) which I'd say is in good condition - it has been faded by the sun.

#### Road to New Jedi Order

Selling for: **£100!** - Less than £1 per book.

The collection is definitely worth WAY more, but I am lazy, so I couldn't be
bothered checking the prices on eBay - definitely an opportunity to make some
money from reselling them

A big collection of Star Wars Legends paperbacks. Every book worth reading
all the way from the beginning of the Expanded Universe (the Thrawn Trilogy) up
to the start of the massive New Jedi Order series, including a few rarer books.

All of these books are paperbacks unless otherwise mentioned and most of them
are 20+ years old. They're all in good condition or better, but keep in mind

## Card Games

### Pokemon TCG

Selling for: **£100!**

Many kilograms of Pokemon cards. Mostly from around 2014-2016, all rarities,
mostly in NM condition, including some unopened boosters. Basically, it's just a
big box of cards that came directly out of Pokemon booster packs!

Probably 5000-10000 cards. I'll include a trades folder with some of the more
interesting/valuable cards in it such as the full art EXes and secret rares.

### Magic: The Gathering

Selling for: **£1,000!**

A ridiculous quantity of MTG cards, from Theros to Ixalan, of all rarities,
mostly NM condition.

I don't have an exact idea of the total value of the cards, but I went through
a bunch of the decks in the box (probably 5-10% of the total collection) sorting
out every card that was worth over £1 and it came to over £700, to give you an
idea. I'd estimate that the total value is probably well over £2,000.

I'll include the box that I have them stored in, but it's almost too heavy to
carry alone. Consider using a handcart for moving them!

## Comics

### Star Wars Comics

All of these comics are in very good condition or better.

LOTS of comics to add here whenever I get around to it. If you're interested,
reach out to me and let me know if there's something you're looking for.

#### Canon Comics

I have almost every Star Wars Canon (Marvel) comic published, in TBP or Omnibus
format. Happy to sell as a complete collection, or as sets of series. For weird
standalone comics, I'll sell them standalone if they're worth it, or as a bundle
of a few - let me know which ones you'd like.

No prices yet because I haven't looked them up, but the more you buy, the bigger
of a discount I'll give you.
